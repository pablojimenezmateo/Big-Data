Tutorials for numba and blz
============================

Do you think python is slow? Or that it cannot work with big data? 

Well, not anymore! With this tutorials I want to show how it is possible to have an astonishingly fast code while you work with big data.

Seems boring you say? 

Well, we are working with lenna, a chicken, Mandelbrot's fractal  and The Garden Of The Earthly Delights, this is as fun as it gets.
